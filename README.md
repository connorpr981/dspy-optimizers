# Demystifying DSPy Optimizers using a Chess Puzzle Benchmark

## Overview

This project explores the inner workings of DSPy optimizers by evaluating their impact on a structured reasoning task: solving single-move chess puzzles. While DSPy provides powerful abstractions that often make deep knowledge of its internals unnecessary, this project aims to peek behind the curtain and understand how different optimization strategies algorithmically improve Large Language Model (LLM) performance.

We use DSPy's core concepts – Signatures and Modules – analogous to high-level programming constructs, and view DSPy Optimizers as "compilers" that translate these high-level specifications into effective prompts and configurations for specific LLMs. The goal is to provide clarity on the mechanisms DSPy employs to enhance LLM capabilities.

## Benchmark Task: Why Chess Puzzles?

Chess puzzles provide a consistent and structured benchmark for this investigation:

- **Objective Correctness**: Solutions are verifiable.
- **Clear Results**: Performance is easily measured by accuracy.
- **Rich Data**: Large datasets are readily available.
- **Focused Scope**: Single-move puzzles constrain the task, isolating the impact of optimizers.

While chess is largely "solved" by traditional AI, it serves as an excellent environment to evaluate how LLMs, guided by DSPy, handle rule-based, structured reasoning.

## Dataset

- **Source**: Lichess Chess Puzzles Dataset on HuggingFace.
- **Filtering**: Only puzzles with exactly one move for each side (two moves total in UCI notation) were used.
- **Sampling**: 1,000 puzzles randomly sampled (seed=42).
- **Split**: 80% train (800 puzzles), 20% test (200 puzzles) (seed=42).
- **Reference Date**: Dataset snapshot from April 5, 2025.
- **Key fields used**: puzzle_fen, moves.

## Setup

- **LLM**: GPT-4.1 (used consistently across experiments).
- **DSPy Program**: A simple dspy.Module using dspy.ChainOfThought with a SolveChessPuzzle signature.
- **Inputs**: Opponent's last move (last_move), board state (board in FEN), legal moves (legal_moves in UCI).
- **Outputs**: Reasoning trace (reasoning), proposed solution move (solution in UCI).

(See the provided notebook for full code implementation.)

## Baseline Performance

An initial baseline was established using the ChessSolver module without any DSPy optimization (no few-shot examples generated or selected by an optimizer).

**Test Set Accuracy**: 29.0%

This baseline serves as a reference point to measure the improvements gained from applying different DSPy optimizers.

## Results Summary

This table summarizes the performance of different DSPy optimizers on the test set (200 puzzles).

| Optimizer | Test Set Accuracy | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| Baseline (No Opt) | 29.0% | Uncompiled program performance. |
| LabeledFewShot | TBD | (Results from Post #1) |
| BootstrapFewShot | TBD | (Results from Post #1) |
| ... (Other Opts) | TBD | (Results from future posts) |

(TBD = To Be Determined)

## Project Goals & Next Steps

This project is part of an ongoing series. The primary goal is to:

1. Implement and evaluate various DSPy optimizers (starting with LabeledFewShot and BootstrapFewShot) on the chess puzzle benchmark.
2. Analyze the underlying algorithms used by these optimizers.
3. Quantify the performance gains achieved by each optimizer relative to the baseline and populate the results table above.
4. Provide clear explanations and insights into how DSPy compilation works in practice.

Future work will involve testing additional optimizers and potentially exploring variations in the benchmark task or model.
